# PostgreSQL & Data Visualization Projects

Welcome to my collection of data projects that combine the power of **PostgreSQL** with compelling **data visualizations** using tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Python-based libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).  
This repository is designed to showcase real-world applications of relational databases and analytical dashboards.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Practice advanced **SQL** querying techniques (e.g., CTEs, window functions, indexing)
- Use **PostgreSQL** as a central data warehouse
- Explore and clean real-world datasets
- Create **insightful visualizations** to support decision-making
- Develop professional **ETL pipelines** and dashboards
- Document the entire process in a reproducible format
